Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the
linked list **sorted** as well.

##### Example 1:

> **Input:** head = [1,1,2]
> **Output:** [1,2]

##### Example 2:

> **Input:** head = [1,1,2,3,3]
> **Output:** [1,2,3]

##### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.
